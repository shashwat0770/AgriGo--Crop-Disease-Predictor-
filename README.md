<h2>Welcome to the Crop Disease Predictor project! This AI-powered application helps farmers and agricultural experts detect crop diseases using 
  Machine Learning (ML) & Deep Learning techniques. By analyzing images of affected crops, the model predicts possible diseases and provides recommendations 
  for treatment, helping improve crop health and yield.
</h2>

<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>
  Image-Based Disease Detection: Upload crop images to detect diseases using a trained ML model.<br>
  AI-Powered Predictions: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other deep learning models for accurate classification.<br>
  Multiple Crop Support: Detects diseases in various crops such as wheat, rice, maize, etc.<br>
  Treatment Recommendations: Provides remedies and preventive measures based on the identified disease.<br>
  User-Friendly Interface: Built with Flask/Django (Python) for easy web-based access.<br>
